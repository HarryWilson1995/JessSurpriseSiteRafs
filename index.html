      <p>As a reward for being such a loyal supporter of Rafs over the years you have been rewarded with a reward of one $20 coupon to spend at Rafs whenever you are there with Harry and Amanda next (providing we actually are able to open)</p>

    <div class="secondary-message">
      <img src="./images//rafs_2.jpg" alt="" class="second-img">
      <p>Enjoy as many vending machine Tuna Sandwiches as $20 can buy or maybe come play pool for free even if it's not Friday. We promise to fill your drink with as many flies as you could possibly want while you play pool, darts, watch people do the craziest shit you have ever seen OR maybe even sample one of our gourmet buffet spreads!</p>

    <div class="closing-message">
      <p>Anything is possible, we look forward to seeing you soon! (Again, providing we actually have the funds to get the lock off the shipping container!</p>
